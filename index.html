        Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose
        music would make a lasting impression internationally. He was honored in 1884 by Tsar Alexander III and awarded
        a
        lifetime pension.

        Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant
        opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no system of public music education. When an
        opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent <a style="text-decoration: none;"

            Conservatory</strong> </a>, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching that he
        received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian
        composers of <a style="text-decoration: none;"

        <strong>The Five,</strong> also known as the <strong>Mighty Handful</strong>, <strong>The Mighty Five</strong>
        , and the <strong>New Russian School</strong>, were five prominent 19th-century Russian composers who worked
        together to create a distinct national style of classical
        music. They are:

        In 1884, Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred
        upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which included a title of hereditary nobility and a
        personal audience with the Tsar. This was seen as a seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's
        social standing and might have been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite

    <h2>Tchaikosky's Death</h2>

      <p>
        While Tchaikovsky's death has traditionally been attributed to cholera from drinking unboiled water at a local
        restaurant, there has been much speculation that his death was suicide. In the New Grove Dictionary of
        Music, Roland John Wiley wrote that "The polemics over [Tchaikovsky's] death have reached an impasse ... Rumors
        attached to the famous die hard ... As for illness, problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory
        resolution: the state of diagnosis; the confusion of witnesses; disregard of long-term effects of smoking and
        alcohol. We do not know how Tchaikovsky died. We may never find out".
